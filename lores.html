            <h3>The Origin of Chakra</h3>
            <p>
                Chakra is the foundation of all ninja techniques in the Naruto world. It originated from the 
                Sage of Six Paths, Hagoromo Otsutsuki, who spread the knowledge of chakra to humanity. 
                Before this, chakra was only used by the Otsutsuki clan for their own purposes.

            <h3>The Tale of the Nine-Tails</h3>
            <p>
                The Nine-Tails, also known as Kurama, is one of the Tailed Beasts created by Hagoromo Otsutsuki. 
                It was sealed inside Naruto Uzumaki after the attack on the Hidden Leaf Village by Obito Uchiha 
                and the Nine-Tails itself. Kurama plays a pivotal role in Naruto's journey as a ninja.

            <h3>The Uchiha Clan's Tragedy</h3>
            <p>
                The Uchiha Clan, one of the most powerful clans in the Hidden Leaf Village, faced a tragic 
                downfall due to internal conflicts and political conspiracies. Itachi Uchiha, under orders 
                from the village elders, wiped out his entire clan to prevent a coup, leaving only his younger 
                brother, Sasuke, alive.
